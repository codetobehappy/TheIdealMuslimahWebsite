<h1> The Ideal Muslimah</h1>
<h2>The Believing woman is alert  (pages 27 to 31) </h2>
<p>
    One of the most prominent distinguishing features of the Muslim woman is her deep faith in Allah 
(SWT), and her sincere conviction that whatever happens in this universe, and whatever fate 
befalls human beings, only happens through the will and decree of Allah (SWT); whatever befalls a 
person could not have been avoided, and whatever does not happen to a person could not have 
been made to happen. A person has no choice in this life but to strive towards the right path and to 
do good deeds - acts of worship and other acts - by whatever means one can, putting all his trust 
in Allah (SWT), submitting to His will, and believing that he is always in need of Allah's (SWT) help 
and support.

The story of Hajar offers the Muslim woman the most marvellous example of deep faith in Allah 
(SWT) and sincere trust in Him. Ibrahim `May peace be upon him' (PBUH) left her at the Ka`bah in 
Makkah, above the well of Zamzam, at a time when there were no people and no water in the 
place. Hajar had no-one with her except her infant son Isma`il. She asked Ibrahim, calmly and 
with no trace of panic: "Has Allah (SWT) commanded you to do this, O Ibrahim?" Ibrahim (PBUH) 
said, "Yes." Her response reflected her acceptance and optimism: "Then He is not going to abandon 
us." Reported by Bukhari in Kitab al-Anbiya1

    QUIZ 2: <br>
    What lesson does the story of Ibrahim’s wife Haajar and her baby on Ishmael teach us?

    <br>

</p>
<p id="answers2" style="color:red">Answer: The example of deep faith and sincere trust in Allah.
     She knew that Allah commanded Ibrahim to sacrifice his family and since it was Allah’s command,
      she knew they would not be abandoned by Allah.
</p>

<p>
Here was an extremely difficult situation: a man left his wife and infant son in a barren land, where 
there were no plants, no water, and no people, and went back to the distant land of Palestine. He 
left nothing with her but a sack of dates and a skin filled with water. Were it not for the deep faith 
and trust in Allah (SWT) that filled Hajar's heart, she would not have been able to cope with such a 
difficult situation; she would have collapsed straight away, and would not have become the woman 
whose name is forever remembered night and day by those who perform hajj and `umrah at the 
house of Allah (SWT), every time they drink the pure water of Zamzam, and run between the 
mounts of Safa' and Marwah, as Hajar did on that most trying day. 
</p>
<p>This deep faith and awareness had an amazing effect on the lives of Muslim men and women: it 
awoke their consciences and reminded them that Allah (SWT) witnesses and knows every secret, 
and that He is with a person wherever he may be. Nothing gives a clearer idea of that 
consciousness and fear of Allah (SWT) at all times than the story of the young Muslim girl related 
in Sifat al-Safwah and Wafiyat al-A'yan and cited by Ibn al-Jawzi in Ahkam al-Nisa' (pp. 441, 442): 
"Narrated `Abdullah ibn Zayd ibn Aslam, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: `When I 
was accompanying `Umar ibn al-Khattab on his patrol of Madinah at night, he felt tired, so he leant 
against a wall. It was the middle of the night, and (we heard) a woman say to her daughter, "O my 
daughter, get up and mix that milk with some water." The girl said, "O Mother, did you not hear 
the decree of Amir al-Mu'minin (chief of the believers) today?" The mother said, "What was that?" 
The girl said, "He ordered someone to announce in a loud voice that milk should not be mixed with 
water." The mother said, "Get up and mix the milk with water; you are in a place where `Umar 
cannot see you." The girl told her mother, "I cannot obey Him (Allah) in public and disobey him in 
private." `Umar heard this, and told me: "O Aslam, go to that place and see who that girl is, and to 
whom she was speaking, and whether she has a husband." So I went to that place, and I saw that 
she was unmarried, the other woman was her mother, and neither of them had a husband. I came 
to `Umar and told him what I had found out. He called his sons together, and said to them: "Do 
any of you need a wife, so I can arrange the marriage for you? If I had the desire to get married, I 
would have been the first one to marry this young woman." `Abdullah said: "I have a wife." `Abd 
al-Rahman said: "I have a wife." `Asim said: "I do not have a wife, so let me marry her." So 
`Umar arranged for her to be married to `Asim. She gave him a daughter, who grew up to be the 
mother of `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz.'" 
</p>
<p>This is the deep sense of awareness that Islam had implanted in the heart of this young woman. 
She was righteous and upright in all her deeds, both in public and in private, because she believed 
that Allah (SWT) was with her at all times and saw and heard everything. This is true faith, and 
these are the effects of that faith, which raised her to the level of ihsan. One of the immediate 
rewards with which Allah (SWT) honoured her was this blessed marriage, one of whose 
descendants was the fifth rightly-guided khalifah, `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz `May Allah be pleased 
with him' (RAA).

    QUIZ 3: <br>
    The girl who would not mix water with milk was recognized by 
Umar ibn al khattab as ----------- and -----------in all her deeds, 
because she believed that Allah was with her at all times and saw all
 her ----------deeds and --------- deeds.

The Aqeedah (faith) of the true Muslim woman is pure and clear, uncontaminated by any stain of 
ignorance, illusion or superstition. This Aqeeda is based on faith in Allah, (SWT) the One, the Most 
High, the Eternal, Who is able to do all things, Who is in control of the entire universe, and to 
<br>
<pre>
Whom all things must return: 

( Say: `Who is it in Whose hands is the governance of all things - Who protects 
[all], but is not protected [by any]? [Say] if you know.' They will say, `[It belongs] 
to Allah,' Say: `Then how are you deluded?') (Qur'an 23:88-89) 
</pre></p>
 <p>
This is the pure, deep faith which increases the character of the Muslim woman in strength, 
understanding and maturity, so that she sees life as it really is, which is a place of testing whose 
results will be seen on the Day which will undoubtedly come: 
<br>
<pre>
( Say: `It is Allah Who gives you life, then gives you death; then He will gather you 
together for the Day of Judgement about which there is no doubt': but most men do 
not understand.) (Qur'an 45:26) 
( Did you then think that We had created you in jest, and that you would not be 
brought back to Us [for account]?) (Qur'an 23:115) 
( Blessed is He in Whose hands is Dominion; and He over all things has Power - He 
Who created Death and Life, that He may try which of you is best in deed; and He is 
the Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving.) (Qur'an 67:1-2) 

On that Day, man will be brought to account for his deeds. If they are good, it will be good for him, 
and if they are bad, it will be bad for him. There will not be the slightest injustice: 
( That Day will every soul be requited for what it earned; no injustice will there be 
that Day, for Allah is Swift in taking account.) (Qur'an 40:17) 
 
</pre></p> 
<p>
The Balance (in which man's deeds will be weighed) will measure everything with the utmost 
precision, either in a person's favour or against him: 
<br>
<pre>

    ( Then shall anyone who has done an atom's weight of good, see it! And anyone 
who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it.) (Qur'an 99:7-8) 

</pre>
</p>
<p> 
Nothing could be hidden from the Lord of Glory on that Day, not even if it were as insignificant as a 
grain of mustard seed: 
<br><pre>
( We shall set up scales of justice for the day of Judgement, so that not a soul will 
be dealt with unjustly in the least. And if there be [no more than] the weight of a 
mustard seed, We will bring it [to account]: and enough are We to take account.) 
(Qur'an 21:47) 
</pre> </p>
 <p>
No doubt the true Muslim woman, when she ponders the meaning of these ayat, would think about 
that crucial Day and would turn to her Lord in obedience, repentance and gratitude, seeking to do 
as many righteous deeds as she is able, in preparation for the Hereafter.
